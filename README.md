In a collaborative health informatics research study, I analyzed the HINTS 6 dataset, studying disparities in colorectal cancer screening. I used Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform much more elaborate data analytics and visualizations regarding the correlations between lifestyle variables and the awareness of screenings. I used data analytics and its application to address public health challenges in a manner that contributed significantly to targeted interventions and policies for the improvement of screening rates and patient outcomes.
